# Results
The following findings have been made based on this study:



- We found that the initial list of employees close to retirement had more than one entry for employees. Hence, we created a list of unique employees who are closing to their retiring age. In the same file, their latest job titles and hiring date are included as reference.

- We were able to show the number of expected retirees per department as represented in the retiring_titles file. This way Pewlett Hackard can anticipate their hiring count in the next couple of years.
